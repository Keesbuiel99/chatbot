<p>You’re sitting in your office chatting away like there’s no tomorrow with your AI powered computer; you are analyzing risk and predicting the future of your company to some extent. Your AI powered computer is projecting 3D interactive data models onto your desk, you are pulling apart the data adding new dimensions and various layers, it’s all going well and the future looks bright. While doing this you ask the computer questions like “show me the value of the risk of insuring commercial property against flood damage within America and the state of Florida and within zip code 33187 and how I can increase my profit by 10% on the value of property between four hundred thousand and nine hundred thousand dollars”. The Ai would then take those values and run equations to produce the answer, boom! What would have taken you hours is accomplished in minutes. Soon you will be able to analyze any risk or anything about your company by simply asking the right question, easy work. All the boring stuff like writing documents, looking through data, building charts, etc will be done for you, basically all the stuff you really don’t want to do but you have to do, the time-consuming stuff.</p>

<p>Most of us have probably seen videos or read articles on the internet about how AI is evolving and how AI is going to replace many of us all by AI powered robots or even drive us to work or a drone is going to deliver pizza to your front door. These videos and articles are very fascinating, even entertaining, to read and watch. But we are a long way off integrating them into our business and everyday lives.</p>

<p>Here, I want to separate the dreams and hype to the reality and what is available for your business today. Many people have seen the technology they want, seen the video, gone to the presentation. They know what they need for their company but don’t really understand how to start on the journey. I want to help you start the journey.</p>

<p>Picture this, at the moment your contact center team is 20 strong with an average waiting time of 8 minutes depending of the time and day. Your business is growing and so is the demand from your customers for better service. The traditional approach to tackling large volumes of call is to hire more people, outsource the calls or restricts the time customers can call; none of these options are scalable or good for business. To add to the problem customer service agents have to capture the details of the call after every call which adds to whole problem. Customers call up for many reasons such as general queries about your product or service and information that can probably be found on your website. These types of calls last only a matter of minutes, but they add up to around 45% of all call volume, what a pain. Plus, you have a 15% churn on your staff and training takes between 2 and 3 weeks.</p>

<p>How great would it be if you could lower the cost of your call center, increase customer service and support your customer 24/7? Well this is completely possible and many companies around the world have already put this in place or are tackling this issue by integrating a <b><a href="https://tonkabi.com/machine-learning">chatbot</a></b> into their business.

<ul>
<li>Reduce contact center pressure.</li>

<li>Increase customer service hours.</li>

A new chatbot process will allow the customer service team to drastically improve their efficiency and customer satisfaction. The team will be more motivated, and productivity will be at an all-time high.</p>
